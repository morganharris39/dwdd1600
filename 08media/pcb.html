            <h1>PCBs</h1>
            <h2>What is a PCB?</h2>
                <p>A PCB is the circuit board that registers each key press.
                Basically, it's what makes your keyboard work. If you have a faulty PCB,
                you don't really have a keyboard. There are two different types of PCB's: soldered and hotswap.</p>
            <h2>How they work</h2>
                    <p>Essentially, there are multiple holes in each section where a switch (and therefore a key) would go.
                        PCB's can either have 3 or five holes, which can sometimes effect the type of switch you have to use.
                        It doesn't effect anything other than that, though. The largest hole in the center is where the large stabalizing pin goes,
                        and surrounding that hole is the 2 registering holes that connect the PCB to the switches. Without this connections,
                        the keyboard won't work.
                    </p>
            <h2>Types of PCB's</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hotswap</strong> - This type of PCB has small little devices placed behing the registering holes, enabling the user to change the switches whenever they please.</lt>
                    <li><strong>Soldered</strong> - These PCB's are missing the little devices mentioned previously. Instead, you would need a soldering machine to attach
                    the switches to the PCB. There is less freedom with these types of PCB's, since you can't change the switch whenever you'd
                    like. That is, unless you have a desoldering machine.</li>
