            <h1>Materials</h1>
            <h2>What are they?</h2>
                <p>Keyboards and switch plates come in a couple of different materials. Different materials
                    most prominently effects the sound of the keyboard, but it also plays into the aesthetics as well.</p>
            <h2>Case Materials</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Plastic</dt>
                        <dd>This material is more common with more budget friendly keyboards. It will often
                            give the keyboard a hollow sound if not made very well.</dd>
                    <dt>Aluminum</dt>
                        <dd>Aluminum is normally used in more expensive keyboards, although there are some budget
                            ones you can find that are made out of aluminum too. Keyboards make out of this materials often
                            gives a better sound profile than plastic ones, although sometimes they can sound quite pingy if they
                            aren't made well.</dd>
                    <dt>Wood</dt>
                        <dd>This material is less common than the previous two, but it is still a very popular choice. It absorbs sound
                            much more than other materials, so the sound profile is a bit deeper.</dd>
                    <dt>Acrylic</dt>
                        <dd>Acrylic is a little different from the previous three, since these types of cases come in many pieces
                            that need to be assembled together. They are normally transparent as well, which offers a pretty cool aesthetic.
                        </dd>
                </dl>
            <h2>Plate Materials</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Pom</dt>
                        <dd>This material is more of a plastic-like material, and offers a lot of flexibility.
                            It provides a deeper sound profile.</dd>
                    <dt>Polycarbonate</dt>
                        <dd>This one is similar to Pom, it offers more flexibility and a deeper sound profile.</dd>
                    <dt>Carbon Fiber</dt>
                        <dd>Carbon Fiber is also similar to Pom and Polycarbonate.</dd>
                    <dt>Aluminum</dt>
                        <dd>Aluminum is very sturdy, and doesn't offer much movement. It can also have a pingy sound.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>There are a bunch of other materials used for both case material and plate materials,
                    but for simpicities sake I've only mentioned the most common.</p>
